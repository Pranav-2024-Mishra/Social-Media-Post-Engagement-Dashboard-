It provides quick insights into engagement metrics, post type distribution, and trends over time, helping users understand their social media content's effectiveness.

**✨ Features**
* **Interactive Data Upload:** Easily upload your social media post data via a CSV file.

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    * Total number of posts.

    * Total Likes, Shares, and Comments across all posts.

    * Average engagement per post.

* **Top Performing Post:** Highlights the post with the highest total engagement, displaying its key metrics.

* **Engagement Breakdown per Post:** Bar chart showing Likes, Shares, and Comments for individual posts (top 20 by engagement for readability).

* **Content Type Distribution:** Pie chart illustrating the proportion of different content types (e.g., Image, Video, Text).

* **Engagement Trends Over Time:** Line chart to visualize how total engagement changes daily.

* **Engagement by Day of the Week:** Bar chart to identify the best performing days for your posts.

* **Engagement Breakdown by Content Type:** Stacked bar chart comparing total Likes, Shares, and Comments generated by each content type.

* **Likes vs. Comments Scatter Plot:** Visualizes the relationship between Likes and Comments, colored by content type and sized by total engagement.

* **Interactive Filters:** Filter data by Content Type and Date Range using sidebar controls.

# Technologies Used

   * Python
   * Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
   * Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
   * Matplotlib: For creating static plots.
   * Seaborn: For enhancing the aesthetics and types of statistical plots.

# Project Structure
        social_media_dashboard/
        ├── app.py
        ├── requirements.txt
        └── Cleaned_Social_Media_Post_Engagement.csv 
        └── README.md

* app.py: The main Streamlit application script.

* requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

* Cleaned_Social_Media_Post_Engagement.csv: A CSV file for testing the dashboard.

# Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

* Clone the repository (or download the files):

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/social_media_dashboard.git
      cd social_media_dashboard

(Replace your-username and social_media_dashboard with your actual GitHub details if you're pushing this to a new repo).

* Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    * Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):

           python -m venv .venv
          .\.venv\Scripts\activate

(If you encounter a script execution error on PowerShell, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser, then try activating again in your regular terminal.)

   * macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):

          python3 -m venv .venv
          source ./.venv/bin/activate

* Install Dependencies:
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:

      pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to run the project

* Prepare your Data:
Ensure your social media post data is in a CSV file with the following exact column headers (case-insensitive, but the script expects these standardized forms after processing):

  * Post_ID (or Post ID)

  * Post_Date (or Post Date)

  * Likes

  * Shares

  * Comments

  * Content_Type (or Content Type, Type)

A sample social_media_data.csv is included for quick testing.

* Run the Streamlit Application:
From your project directory (with the virtual environment activated), execute:

      streamlit run app.py

* Access the Dashboard:
Your web browser will automatically open a new tab displaying the dashboard (usually at http://localhost:8501).

* Upload your CSV:
Use the "Choose a CSV file" button in the sidebar to upload your social media data. The dashboard will then populate with your insights.
