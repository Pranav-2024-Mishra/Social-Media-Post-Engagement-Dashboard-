📁 Project Structure
social_media_dashboard/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── social_media_data.csv (example data)
└── README.md

app.py: The main Streamlit application script.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

social_media_data.csv: An optional sample CSV file for testing the dashboard.

⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository (or download the files):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/social_media_dashboard.git
cd social_media_dashboard

(Replace your-username and social_media_dashboard with your actual GitHub details if you're pushing this to a new repo).

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

(If you encounter a script execution error on PowerShell, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser, then try activating again in your regular terminal.)

macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):

python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
Prepare your Data:
Ensure your social media post data is in a CSV file with the following exact column headers (case-insensitive, but the script expects these standardized forms after processing):

Post_ID (or Post ID)

Post_Date (or Post Date)

Likes

Shares

Comments

Content_Type (or Content Type, Type)

A sample social_media_data.csv is included for quick testing.

Run the Streamlit Application:
From your project directory (with the virtual environment activated), execute:

streamlit run app.py

Access the Dashboard:
Your web browser will automatically open a new tab displaying the dashboard (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Upload your CSV:
Use the "Choose a CSV file" button in the sidebar to upload your social media data. The dashboard will then populate with your insights.
